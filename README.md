Task 1 :-
Grayscale Image Enhancement for Improved Colorization

üìå Description
This project aims to improve the outcomes of automatic image colorization by applying simple grayscale image enhancement techniques as a pre-processing step. The enhanced images exhibit improved contrast and reduced noise, which helps colorization models produce more visually appealing results.

üß† Objective
Enhance grayscale historical or old photographs before applying deep learning-based colorization by:

Improving contrast using histogram equalization.

Reducing noise using Gaussian blur.

This enhancement improves the visual quality of input images and helps colorization models better identify and color various regions.

üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Used
1. Histogram Equalization
Enhances the global contrast of the image.

Helps in better feature separation, especially for faded or low-light images.

2. Gaussian Blur
Removes high-frequency noise and smoothens the image.

Preserves important edges while reducing minor pixel-level noise.
